// #22 — how the explanation was DELIVERED, as opposed to whether it was
// understood. Everything here is counted from the transcript, never asked
// from a model, so the same lesson always produces the same numbers.
//
// Scope is deliberately narrow. The idea file that proposed this flagged the
// risk itself: pace and hesitation are one short step from sounding like a
// personality reading. Nothing here infers a state of mind — it counts words
// that were said and reports the count. "You hedged eleven times" is a fact
// about the transcript; "you sounded unsure" is not, and is not on this card.

// Sounds that fill a gap while the next thought arrives. Kept separate from
// hedges below so a lesson can be fluent and uncommitted, or halting and
// definite, without the two collapsing into one number.
// Kept per-language rather than merged into one list. German "also" is a
// filler; English "also" is an ordinary connective, and a shared list would
// count it every time an English speaker used it properly.
//
// Without the German half this card reported zero fillers and zero hedges on
// every German lesson, then printed prose approving of it — the measurement
// silently not running rather than running badly.
