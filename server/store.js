// Teach-off storage (#34): the challenges and every run against them, and
// the quiz side-mode's live games (bottom half of this file).
//
// Two backends behind one interface, chosen by whether Upstash credentials
// are present:
//
//   Redis    — when UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL and _TOKEN are set. This is what
//              a deployed build uses, and it is the only way a code created
//              on a phone can be joined from a laptop.
//   JSON file — otherwise. Unchanged from the original single-machine
//              build, so `npm run dev` needs no account and no network, and
//              a laptop demo behaves exactly as it always has.
//
// The split exists because serverless has no durable disk. On Vercel the
// filesystem is read-only apart from /tmp, /tmp does not survive between
// invocations, and two concurrent instances share nothing. A file-backed
// board would appear to work whenever both requests happened to land on the
// same warm instance and fail the rest of the time — which is worse than
// failing outright, because it passes casual testing and breaks on stage.

//
// A game is two keys:
//
//   quiz:<code>        the questions. Written once, never again — so the
//                      correct answers live somewhere the client cannot
//                      reach until the game is over.
//   quiz:<code>:live   EVERYTHING that changes, as one hash.
//
// One hash rather than a key per concern is what makes this affordable and
// correct at the same time. Affordable, because both devices poll this while
// the game runs and HGETALL fetches the lot in a single command — five keys
// would be five commands per poll per player, several thousand across one
// game, against an Upstash free tier that counts them.
//
// Correct, because every write is HSET on its own field. Two players tapping
// an easy question inside the same 50ms is not a rare event in a race game,
// and read-modify-write on one JSON blob would silently drop one of those
// answers — a wrong final score with nothing in any log to explain it.
//
// Fields, all flat:
//   created            when the game was made
//   run                epoch ms the host pressed start; absent means lobby
//   p:<playerId>       { id, name, joinedAt }
